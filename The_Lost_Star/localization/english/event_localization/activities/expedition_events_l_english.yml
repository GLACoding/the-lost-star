 expedition.4001.t:2 "The Planetarium"
 expedition.4001.opening:2 "As you enter a darkened room you are suddenly dazzled by a burst of light, where once the ceiling was a void it is now furnished with the trappings of the night sky with brilliantly glowing lines and shapes heralding different parts of what, at least by the account of a few golden plaques and blinking screens, were the holdings of a grand solar empire!"
 expedition.4001.opening.2:2 "\n\nYou are struck still by the majestic sight, but once you have regained your senses, you wonder whether to take the time to peruse the long lost secrets of the stars surely held within these walls, or to perhaps focus on more worldly concerns… "

 expedition.4002.t:2 "Gargantuan Warehouse"
 expedition.4002.opening:2 "Pushing aside the overgrown vines clinging to a doorway, I beheld a gargantuan warehouse, its rows of metal boxes seemingly stretching out to the horizon. Strange metal contraptions lay dormant, their labour’s half finished. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light filtering through cracked windows, illuminating what looks to be a scriptorium of some kind."
 expedition.4002.opening.2:2 "\n\nYou feel it would take a hundred of the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName]’s most diligent regiment’s years to search through all this, and a quick inspection of a few nearby boxes predicts many of these containers are empty or bereft of anything useful. Perhaps a good stewards can make sense of the paperwork left in the scriptorium?"

 expedition.5001.t:2 "Fuse Box"
 expedition.5001.opening:2 "The work on uncovering the artefact is well underway, but has been somewhat hampered by the patchy lighting. The workman must navigate pitch black rooms with caution, significantly slowing down work progress."
 expedition.5001.opening.2:2 "\n\n[expedition_participant.GetTitledFirstName] calls out to you from a nearby hallway, "We've got something you might want to take a look at [host.GetTitledFirstName]""
 expedition.5001.opening.3:2 "\n\n[expedition_participant.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] leads me to some kind of metal cupboard attached to the wall, filled with strange metal tubes and blinking lights "A manual we found describes a "fuse box" that could fix the ancient lights, we think this might be it but we don't know how to "reset it" as the manual describes""
